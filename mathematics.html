    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Mathematics are the abstract science of numbers, quantity, and space.</p>
    <p>They are broken down into several areas.</p>

    <h2>Number theory</h2>
    <p><strong>Number theory</strong> is the study of integers and arithmetic functions.</p>

    <h2>Arithmetic</h2>
    <p><strong>Arithmetic</strong> is the study of numerical operations like addition or division.</p>

    <h2>Geometry</h2>
    <p><strong>Geometry</strong> is the study of space and shapes.</p>

    <h3>Point</h3>
    <p>A <strong>point</strong> is a fundamental entity which represent a position in space, without <strong>size</strong>, or <strong>rotation</strong>.</p>
    <p>Points do not have dimension. They are purely abstract objects.</p>

    <h3>Line</h3>
    <p>A <strong>line</strong> is a fundamental figure which represent a straight line infinite in both directions, without <strong>thickness</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Triangle</h3>
    <p>A <strong>triangle</strong> is a plane figure formed by 3 segments which connect 3 non aligned points called <strong>summits</strong>.</p>
    <p>It's the three-sided polygon, and the simplest polygonal figure.</p>
