        <p>The 4 basic operations are <strong>addition</strong>, <strong>subtraction</strong>, <strong>multiplication</strong> and <strong>division</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Addition</h2>
        <p>Addition combine two numbers to form a third number, called their <strong>sum</strong>. This operation is commutative.</p>
        <p>Additions are written in the form $n+m$.</p>
        <p>The identity of addition is 0. In other words, it means than adding 0 to any numbers do not change it.</p>

        <h2>Subtraction</h2>
        <p>Subtraction involves decreasing a numbers by another number. It is the inverse operation of addition.</p>
        <p>The resulting number is called the <strong>difference</strong>. This operation is <strong>not</strong> commutative.</p>
        <p>Subtractions are written in the form $n-m$.</p>
        <p>The identity of subtraction is 0.</p>

        <h2>Multiplication</h2>
        <p>Multiplication combine two numbers to form a third number, called their <strong>product</strong>. This operation is commutative.</p>
        <p>Multiplications are written in the form $n\times m$.</p>
        <p>The identity of multiplication is 1.</p>

        <h2>Division</h2>
        <p>Division involves dividing a quantity into equal parts. It is the inverse operation of multiplication.</p>
        <p>The resulting number is called the <strong>fraction</strong>. This operation is <strong>not</strong> commutative.</p>
        <p>Divisions are written in the form $n\div m$.</p>
        <p>If a number $n$ if divisible by $k$ if $n\div k$ is an integer.</p>
        <p>The identity of division is 1.</p>
