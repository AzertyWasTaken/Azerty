    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, called terms.</p>
    <p>The number of elements is called the <strong>length</strong> of the sequence.</p>
    <p>The <strong>length</strong> of a sequence can be infinite.</p>

    <h2>Types of sequences</h2>
    <h3>Arithmetic</h3>
    <p>An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by adding to the previous one a fixed number called the <strong>common difference</strong>.</p>
    <p>They can be defined with a formula on the form $nm+k$.</p>

    <h3>Geometric</h3>
    <p>A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed number called the <strong>common ratio</strong>.</p>
    <p>They can be defined with a formula on the form $m^{n}k$.</p>

    <h3>Reccurent</h3>
    <p>A reccurent sequence is a sequence defined by a relation between several terms.</p>
    <p>Arithmetic and geometric sequences are reccurent sequences.</p>
