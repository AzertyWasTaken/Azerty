        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Simplex sequences are sequences that appear in the diagonals of Pascal triangle.</p>

        <h2>Triangular sequence</h2>
        <p>The triangular sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by adding to the previous number the number of the term.</p>

        <h3>First terms</h3>
        <p>$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...$</p>

        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>The sum of two consecutive terms are always square numbers.</p>

        <h3>Formula</h3>
        <p>$n\times (n+1)\div 2$</p>

        <h2>Tetrahedral sequence</h2>
        <p>The triangular sequence is a sequence where each term $n$ after the first is found by adding to the previous number the $n$th term of the triangular sequence.</p>

        <h3>First terms</h3>
        <p>$1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, ...$</p>
